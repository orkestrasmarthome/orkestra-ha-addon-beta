# Orkestra Staging — Development & Testing Build

**Orkestra Staging** is the same Brain + Gateway as production, preconfigured to talk to the **staging API** for local testing and development.

## When to use this add-on

- Testing new Orkestra features before they ship to production
- Developing against `https://staging-api.orkestra-assistant.com`
- Running a staging instance side-by-side with the production **Orkestra** add-on

## Getting Started

1. Click **Install** and start the add-on.
2. Open the **Configuration** tab and enter your **Orkestra Cloud** credentials:
   - **Orkestra Cloud URL** — defaults to `https://staging-api.orkestra-assistant.com`
   - **Orkestra Instance Token** — from your staging Orkestra Cloud account
3. Save, restart the add-on if prompted, then open **Orkestra Staging** from the Home Assistant sidebar (flask icon).

Home Assistant API access is configured automatically — no long-lived access token required for normal add-on use.
